I am the programmer of my high school robot competition team, we win the Judge Award and Top 16 in the World Championship 2016.
During the preparation of the game, I develop an auto-program for the robot to load and launch, saving 90% time than manual. This auto-program are shared and used in all allied team.
This is the start of my robot programming. I leaned more than knowledge of any robot programming knowledge, I learned the complex relationship of client and developer ( in this case, my robot driver and me).

You can watch the competition video on Youtube:
