Currently, we are living in a different world because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The effects of Covid-19 have been detrimental to the world and we are still reeling from it. Loss of innumerable lives, loss of livelihoods and damage to economies are some of the calamitous effects of the pandemic. 

So, our group has decided to work on a topic related to Covid-19. There are several research areas associated with Covid-19. Our work will be focused around Covid-19 detection in patients. This will be primarily a classification project.


For the image classification, we will be following a dual pathway:
We will extract features from the images and then use these as inputs to ML techniques such as KNN and Logistic Regression.
For image classification tasks, our primary focus will be on using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our plan is to initially construct a basic CNN model using our own architecture and analyze the performance. Then we would like to utilize the concepts of transfer learning and fine-tuning for classification. We would like to use pre-trained models/networks such as VGG16 and Resnet18 to understand whether we can improve upon our base CNN model
