Misconduct analysis in terms of different locations and communities can be valuable. Is there over-policing in low socio-eco status neighborhoods? We could compare the low-income area data with high in-come area data. The income of the neighbor could be a factor to influence the “victim” narrative (complaint report). We plan to dive deep into the relationship between location, income level, and police misconduct.
