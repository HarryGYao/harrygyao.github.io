title: About me
subtitle: Hello, nice to meet you!
---

My name is **Wentao Yao**. I am pursuing a master’s degree in computer science with an artificial intelligence specialization at Northwestern University, and my career aspiration is to find a job in a company that will let me use my skills and imagination to break new ground in the field. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

### MY INTERESTED FIELD
I am looking to apply my skills and abilities to a challenging, growth-oriented position with a leading company. While continuing to build my academic foundation, especially in Artificial Intelligent my previous experiences have allowed me to develop software development and program planning abilities. I am eager for the opportunity to learn from and support the team by applying my knowledge of databases, programming languages, and experience in robot programming. 
 
My focus, as an aspiring professional, is to utilize my strengths in peer relationships to make a positive impact on the overall organization. I enjoy gathering, organizing, and analyzing information, working in groups, and contributing to project strategies.
