subtitle: Hello, nice to meet you!
---

Hello and welcome! My name is **Wentao Yao**, and I am a new graduate who has been working at Samsung as an SSD firmware engineer. As an SSD firmware engineer, my expertise lies in designing, developing, and implementing firmware for solid-state drives (SSDs). I have a deep understanding of various storage technologies and protocols, including PCIe and NVMe. My experience includes working with different firmware development tools, such as C/C++, and Python, to create firmware that delivers superior performance and reliability. While my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence may seem unrelated to this position, I believe that my academic background has equipped me with a unique set of skills that allow me to excel in firmware development.

During my time at Samsung, I have gained valuable experience in developing and testing firmware for NVMe-based storage devices. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products and have contributed to improving the performance and reliability of our firmware solutions.

My academic background in Artificial Intelligence has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages, data analysis, and algorithm development. I believe that these skills are highly relevant to firmware engineering and enable me to approach firmware design with a unique perspective.

My passion for technology and desire to continuously learn and grow drive me to seek new challenges and opportunities. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to help develop innovative firmware solutions that meet the needs of the market and customers.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities further.

Diversity and inclusion are fundamental values that I uphold and promote in all aspects of my life, including my professional work. I strongly support the LGBT community and believe in creating an inclusive and safe environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Although I am not a member of the LGBT community, I stand in solidarity with them and will continue to advocate for their rights and equality.

I have been a proud supporter of the LGBT community for a long time and have taken various actions to promote their rights and equality. As part of my ongoing commitment, I regularly donate to [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/){:target="_blank"}, an organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth. I believe in the importance of taking action and making a difference, and I encourage everyone to join me in supporting this critical cause.
